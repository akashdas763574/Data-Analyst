CAPSTONE PROJECT

#PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project focuses on analyzing retail store sales data to uncover meaningful insights that can support business decision-making. The dataset includes customer demographics, product details, regional sales, pricing, discounts, and daily transaction data.

Using Python and SQL within a Jupyter Notebook environment, the data was cleaned, stored in a SQLite database, and analyzed using SQL queries. Key metrics such as total sales over time, sales distribution by region and product category, and top-performing brands were identified. Visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to build an interactive dashboard-like experience.
